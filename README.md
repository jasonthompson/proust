# README
Proust is a blogging platform influenced by the blogging platform constructed in 
Avdi Grimm's [Objects on Rails](http://objectsonrails.com). This will be my 
first complete rails app.

My goal is create a simple blog framework with only the features needed 
to reproduce my personal [wordpress blog](http://www.jthompson.ca):

- blog posts (in markdown)
- pages (in markdown)
- tags
- comments
- [Draft](http://www.draftin.com) integration

The minimum viable product will not include comments or Draft integration.
